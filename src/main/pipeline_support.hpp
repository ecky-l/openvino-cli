// The pipeline-binding layer -- the seam between the subcommand front-end (commands.cpp,
// which only selects a pipeline by the --pipeline value) and each pipeline's body.
//
// It owns two things that the design (runModeEntry -> "use pipelineBinding to create
// Pipeline, create sessionDispatcher, then call .run()/ .worker()") gathers OUT of the
// bodies and makes GENERAL:
//
//   * PipelineParsed -- one *parsed* argument set for a single run/worker invocation: the
//     four typed config layers (load / runtime / scheduler / request) the body needs, plus
//     the run-form's direct --input (nullopt for a worker) and the raw model / device /
//     the --pipeline value the body was selected by (so a body can log them).  This is what
//     the argument parsing produces; the parsing itself is the ONE general front-end parse
//     (commands.cpp runModeEntry -> the free function parsePipelineArgs), done ONCE per
//     invocation and HANDED to the -- so that a body neither re-parses the command line nor
//     needs the raw argv at all.  It is pipeline-agnostic: every body receives the same
//     shape; `vlm` consumes them to load + generate, and the 13 not-yet-implemented stubs
//     consume only model / device.
//   * PipelineBinding + the registry -- { name, description, run } per canonical pipeline,
//     in a MAP keyed by name (so run/worker route by a single lookup -- a find -- not a
//     linear scan, the requested change from a vector).  `vlm` has a real body (load a
//     VLMPipeline, bind to a SessionDispatcher, run/worker it); the rest share the
//     infrastructure-only stub (kept in commands.cpp -- front-end infra -- so the
//     front-end's real --help stays the single source of truth, and a future body plugs
//     in here unchanged).
